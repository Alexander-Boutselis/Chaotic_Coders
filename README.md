Project chosen: Hotel Reservation Desktop Application

Project description

This Hotel Reservation App will have the ability to allow different users to log in (User / Manager). Users will be able to Search for rooms based on their price, size, and availability. Users will then be able to Reserve their selected room(s). Users will also have the ability to modify their reservations. Modifications include changing rooms, canceling their reservation, or changing the day of their reservation. 

Managers will inherit the same abilities as the user but they will have elevated access to reservations, allowing them to change the status of a room, modify the prices, and cancel reservations. Any time a change is made to a reservation the user who made the reservation and the manager will receive a report with the room number, date modified/canceled, price of room, duration of stay, and what was modified.
