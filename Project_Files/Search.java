	 *Ideas for Search Strategy
	 * Idea #1: Use the Array of reservations to check if a Room has been reserved during the time selected
	 * 
	 * Idea #2: Add a flag on rooms for no reservations, search through those first, if no rooms matching search parameters, check the list of rooms and check if already reserved for the same period of time
	 * 
	 * Idea #3: When selecting the dates grab all rooms availible during that time, then check for search parameters.
	 * 
	 * Idea #4: Sharing is caring, let reservations overlap for now and worry about this later once data is stored in database
